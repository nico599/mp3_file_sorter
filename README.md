# mp3_file_sorter

This helps you sort mp3 into folders by using the easyid3 to read meta-tags on the mp3.
It only cares about artist and album. Copying files into //folder//artist//album

## todo

its a work in progress I intend to: 
- re-run it over mp3 already in folders in order to consolidate.
- figure out how to delete the erroneous ones. (already removed many empty folders which is an outcome of either of the above artefacts containing special characters)
